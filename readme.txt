== Description ==
In search engine optimization (SEO) terminology, black hat SEO refers to the use of aggressive SEO strategies, techniques and tactics that focus only on search engines and not a human audience, and usually does not obey search engines guidelines. More info: http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/Black_Hat_SEO.html

There has been an increase in attacks on wp sites where attackers implant malicous contents into your posts and pages that are not visible to human users but visible to crawlers such as google. Therefore we made this plugin, which will scan through all your posts and pages purging for any malicious black-hat SEO infection.

However, you would still need to find and remove the virus that generates this malicious infection, which is usually impeded within a form of plugin.

How to use:

* Find the signature of the infection. usually it got \" style: \" with weird padding, alignment numbers etc (to hide from human user).
* Please make sure to make a full backup of your DB in case you want to revert back.
* There are few control checkboxs to target certain pages or posts, if you wish.
